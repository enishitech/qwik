Public Domain Icons

     These icons were originally made for Mosaic for X and have been
     included in the NCSA httpd and Apache server distributions in the
     past. They are in the public domain and may be freely included in any
     application. The originals were done by Kevin Hughes 
     (kevinh@kevcom.com).

     Many thanks to Andy Polyakov for tuning the icon colors and adding a
     few new images. If you'd like to contribute additions or ideas to
     this set, please let me know.

     Almost all of these icons are 20x22 pixels in size.  There are
     alternative icons in the "small" directory that are 16x16 in size,
     provided by Mike Brown (mike@hyperreal.org).
